# datacake-python-streamlit-graphql-example
Example of how to use [Datacake](https://datacake.co/) with Python and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) over GraphQL.

## Data

In this example, we use a demo workspace on Datacake by integrating 135 [Blues Wireless AirNote](https://blues.io/products/airnote/) Devices.

The Python script reads these devices via GraphQL and visualizes them in Streamlit.

### Token

The tokens stored in this Python script are only responsible for reading the data and have no write permissions. They are here just for demoing purposes. This is intended.

## Installation

Head over to Streamlit Documentation.
